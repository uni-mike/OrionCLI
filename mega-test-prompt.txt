Create a complete project analysis and deployment preparation suite: 

First, search the web for "best practices nodejs cli tools 2024" to get current standards. Then list all files in the project. Read package.json, README.md, and orion.js to understand the project. Use grep to find all TODO comments in the codebase. Use glob to find all *.js files. 

Create a comprehensive-analysis/ directory with the following:

1. Create comprehensive-analysis/web-research.md with the web search results about best practices
2. Create comprehensive-analysis/architecture-diagram.mermaid with a flowchart showing: Start -> Input Processing -> Tool Selection -> Execution -> Output
3. Create comprehensive-analysis/todo-list.md with all TODOs found in the codebase
4. Create comprehensive-analysis/code-review.md analyzing code quality of orion.js

Now create comprehensive-analysis/new-tools/ directory and write new tool examples:
5. Create new-tools/calculator-tool.js with a simple calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods
6. Create new-tools/weather-tool.js with a mock weather fetching tool
7. Create new-tools/crypto-tool.js with base64 encoding/decoding functions

Test system operations:
8. Check git status and create comprehensive-analysis/git-status.txt with the output
9. Get system info and save to comprehensive-analysis/system-info.txt
10. Check memory usage and save to comprehensive-analysis/memory-stats.txt
11. List environment variables and save important ones to comprehensive-analysis/env-vars.txt

Create deployment preparation:
12. Create comprehensive-analysis/docker/Dockerfile with a basic Node.js container setup
13. Create comprehensive-analysis/docker/docker-compose.yml for the application
14. SSH to 10.0.10.11 and check if Docker is running (just check, don't modify), save status to comprehensive-analysis/remote-docker-status.txt
15. Create comprehensive-analysis/deployment-checklist.md with pre-deployment steps

Data processing:
16. Create comprehensive-analysis/data/sample.json with {"name": "OrionCLI", "version": "1.0", "status": "ready"}
17. Convert the JSON to base64 and save to comprehensive-analysis/data/sample.b64
18. Create comprehensive-analysis/data/hashes.txt with MD5 and SHA256 hashes of "OrionCLI"

Testing and validation:
19. Create comprehensive-analysis/tests/unit-test.js with a simple test for the calculator tool
20. Create comprehensive-analysis/tests/integration-test.js with a test for file operations
21. Edit the unit-test.js file to add a comment "// Test validated by OrionCLI"

Documentation:
22. Create comprehensive-analysis/docs/api-reference.md with documentation for all file tools
23. Create comprehensive-analysis/docs/user-guide.md with usage examples
24. Create comprehensive-analysis/docs/troubleshooting.md with common issues

Performance analysis:
25. Count all lines of code in .js files and save to comprehensive-analysis/metrics/loc.txt
26. List the 10 largest files in the project and save to comprehensive-analysis/metrics/largest-files.txt
27. Create comprehensive-analysis/metrics/complexity-report.md analyzing code complexity

Final summary:
28. Create comprehensive-analysis/REPORT.html with an HTML page summarizing everything found
29. Create comprehensive-analysis/next-steps.md with recommendations for improvements
30. Finally, list all files created in comprehensive-analysis/ and save the list to comprehensive-analysis/manifest.txt
